#  Agentic-AI-Foundations

A structured exploration of **Agentic AI systems** — focused on building stateful, orchestrated, and production-oriented LLM workflows.

After ~1.5 years in Machine Learning and Deep Learning (culminating in Transformers), this repository marks the transition into designing intelligent systems that coordinate, reason, and act.

This is not a single project.  
It is a foundation layer for building scalable AI agents.
