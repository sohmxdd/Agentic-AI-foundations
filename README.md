#  Agentic-AI-Foundations

A structured exploration of **Agentic AI systems** — focused on building stateful, orchestrated, and production-oriented LLM workflows.

After ~1.5 years in Machine Learning and Deep Learning (culminating in Transformers), this repository marks the transition into designing intelligent systems that coordinate, reason, and act.

This is not a single project.  
It is a foundation layer for building scalable AI agents.

##  What This Repository Covers

- Prompt-chained LLM agents  
- Stateful execution graphs (LangGraph)  
- Agent orchestration patterns  
- Tool integration workflows  
- Structured reasoning pipelines  
- Multi-step decision systems
